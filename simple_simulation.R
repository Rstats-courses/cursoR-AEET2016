#Simulate data----

#a random variable (rnorm, rpois...)

#a uniform variable

#Elements of a simulation:
#1) an object to store the outputs
#2) outputs

#dynaiÂ¡mics of a simulation.
#1) create an object to store the outputs
#2) create 1 set of values
#3) store them
#4) repeat 2) and 3) as needed.

#species abundances
#starting point: a lognormal distribution 

#create a dataframe to store data
#simulate 1 years of data assuming t+1 = t + error (normally distributed)


#simulate 100 years now




#plot one species trajectory




#make a function out of it



#play with it!
sim(mean = 0, sd = 10)

#simulate independent errors for each species now



sim(mean = 0, sd = 10)

#Detect extinctions


sim(mean = 0, sd = 10)

#A word of caution, never do significant tests in simulations!
